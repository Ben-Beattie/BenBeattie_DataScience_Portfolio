# Ben Beattie Data Science Portfolio
My Name is Ben Beattie and I am a current second year data science student at RMIT in Melbourne. This GitHub repository contains my Data science projects which I have completed. Projects have been completed with a combination of Python and R coding languages, utilising a number of libararies and different skills.

### Social Media Mood Prediction
This project utilises Python to predict social media users moods based upon their social media interactions and engagement. A number of libraries were used including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visulisations and exploratory analysis, and sklearn for machine learning.
