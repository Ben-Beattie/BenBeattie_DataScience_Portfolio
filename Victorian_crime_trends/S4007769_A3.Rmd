## Introduction
<div class="multi-column">
<div class="small-text">
Crime is a complex and evolving issue across Victoria, influencing public safety, policy, and community wellbeing. In recent years, growing attention has been directed toward youth crime as a significant area of concern and danger to local communities. Youth offenders have been responsible for serious crimes including aggravated burglaries and car thefts.


With growing concern among Victorians about crime within the community, these slides investigate the current state of crime in Victoria, with a focus on rising youth crime through examination of offender numbers, offence locations and the types of crime.

- One major concern of many Victorians is youth crime, with all age groups under 18 being up on previous years
- Both 10-14 year old and 15-17 age groups in 2024 saw increased numbers of offences, and strayed away from the general trend line of previous years, where youth crime was consistent

- Since a rise in crime committed by youths is present all across Victoria which crimes are youths committing?
- The main offence type which has seen a rise over the past year in Victoria by youth offenders is property and deception offences, up almost 5% in just one year
- Property and deception offences involve dishonesty and interference with property, with offences such as theft, burglary and robbery being included
- Other offences have remained at a similar level to previous years, however crimes against the person have decreased by over 3%

## State of crime
<div class="multi-column">
<div class="small-text">
In Victoria, the total number of offences has been at a decade-long high in 2024, with a rise in the number of youth offenders committing crimes, which is of concern to our community. Youth crime occurs in all areas of the state, impacting all members of the community, with hotspots occurring in LGAâ€™s including Melbourne, Latrobe, Mount Alexander and Wodonga. These youth offenders are committing a rising number of property and deception offences.
